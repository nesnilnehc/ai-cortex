name: run-repair-loop
status: experimental

primary_use: Iteratively review changes, run automated tests, apply targeted fixes, and repeat until tests pass and no blocking review findings remain (or stop conditions are hit).

inputs:
  - target repository path (default .)
  - scope (diff | codebase)
  - test mode (fast | ci | full)
  - constraints (allow installs, allow network, allow Docker/services)
  - max_iterations (default 5)

outputs:
  - repair loop report (iterations, commands run, failures, patches applied, final convergence state)
