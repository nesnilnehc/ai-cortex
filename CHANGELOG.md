# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed (Governance)

- Calibration outputs now overwrite canonical files per `docs/ARTIFACT_NORMS.md` (doc-readiness, planning alignment, architecture compliance, cognitive loop); snapshots only when explicitly requested.
- Updated output paths and versions for `assess-doc-readiness`, `align-planning`, `align-architecture`, `run-checkpoint`, and `run-repair-loop` to reduce redundant report artifacts.
- **run-checkpoint v1.2.0** — Phase 0.5 Planning Readiness Gate; discover-document-norms, bootstrap-docs in preparation flow; short-circuit with Minimal Fill Plan when readiness missing
- **Skill naming (excellent standard per 20260310-skill-naming-audit)**:
  - `orchestrate-governance-loop` → `run-checkpoint`
  - `assess-documentation-readiness` → `assess-doc-readiness`
  - `bootstrap-project-documentation` → `bootstrap-docs`
  - `validate-document-artifacts` → `validate-doc-artifacts`
  - Consistent `doc` terminology across doc-related skills
- `spec/skill.md` v2.5.0 — naming priority rule: semantic correctness and normativity first, colloquial and memorable second

### Added

- `docs/ARTIFACT_NORMS.md` — project artifact norms defining canonical, non-snapshot calibration outputs.
- `align-architecture` skill (v1.0.0) — verify ADR/design vs code implementation; produce Architecture Compliance Report

### Removed

- One-off calibration reports and a completed backlog item that are superseded by canonical living artifacts.
- Architecture Compliance scenario in scenario-map.json (short triggers: align architecture, architecture compliance, design vs code)

### Changed (Alignment)

- `align-execution` (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0) — slimmed to planning layer only; removed Architecture layer and Architecture Drift; handoff to `align-architecture` for design vs code compliance
- `align-execution` → `align-planning` — renamed for semantic clarity (planning vs implementation boundary)
- `run-checkpoint` (formerly orchestrate-governance-loop) — removed trigger-based routing; unified sequence (align-planning → assess-doc-readiness) + output-driven follow-ups (align-architecture, run-repair-loop, brainstorm-design, analyze-requirements); trigger as metadata only
- `scripts/generate-skillgraph.mjs` — added align-architecture to lifecycle chain and project governance loop; updated governance loop diagram for unified sequence
- `skills/ASQM_AUDIT.md` — curate-skills: added align-architecture (Quality 20, validated); updated align-planning overlaps

### Changed (previous)

- **Skill naming (spec verb-noun compliance)**: `documentation-readiness` → `assess-documentation-readiness`, `execution-alignment` → `align-execution`, `project-cognitive-loop` → `orchestrate-governance-loop`; all references updated across manifest, scenario-map, scripts, docs
- `scripts/generate-skillgraph.mjs` — auto-generate `skills/skillgraph.md` from manifest and SKILL frontmatter; includes global overview
- `scripts/generate-scenario-map.mjs` — auto-generate `skills/scenario-map.md` from `skills/scenario-map.json`
- `scripts/generate-skills-docs.mjs` — wrapper to run both generators
- `skills/scenario-map.json` — source of truth for scenario-to-skill mapping (edit this, not scenario-map.md)

### Changed (Automation)

- `skills/skillgraph.md` — now auto-generated; adds global overview section (Code Review, Lifecycle, Onboarding, Governance, Standalone)
- `skills/scenario-map.md` — now auto-generated from scenario-map.json
- `scripts/verify-registry.mjs` — runs generate-skills-docs before validation; validates scenario-map.json skill refs
- `spec/skill.md` §9 — documents generation; scenario-map source is now scenario-map.json

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- `execution-alignment` skill — post-task traceback, drift detection, and top-down calibration
- `docs/requirements-planning/` and `docs/architecture/` — minimal scaffolding; point to goals, roadmap, milestones
- `documentation-readiness` skill — documentation evidence assessment and minimal-fill plan
- `project-cognitive-loop` skill — orchestrate governance cycles (requirements, design, alignment, docs)
- `skills/scenario-map.md` — scenario-to-skill mapping for task-based discovery
- `agent.yaml` and README for execution-alignment, documentation-readiness, project-cognitive-loop
- `analyze-requirements` skill (v1.0.0) — transform vague intent into validated requirements
- I/O schema contracts for 7 previously missing skills
- Verification script enhancements: agent.yaml/README.md existence, related_skills validity, marketplace.json sync
- CHANGELOG.md

### Changed

- `skillgraph.md` — added project governance loop (analyze-requirements → brainstorm-design → execution-alignment → documentation-readiness → project-cognitive-loop)
- `project-cognitive-loop` — single-artifact output rule; Recommended Next Tasks (owner, scope, rationale); no separate outputs from routed skills
- `analyze-requirements` default output path to `docs/requirements-planning/` (keeps `docs/requirements/` compatible)
- Curate Skills audit: ASQM_AUDIT §6.5, §7; run-repair-loop README status and scores normalized
- Graduated `run-automated-tests` and `run-repair-loop` from experimental (v0.1.0) to stable (v1.0.0)
- Upgraded `schemas/skill-metadata.json` to spec v2.2.0 (added `input_schema`/`output_schema` fields)
- Updated CI workflow version references from spec v2.0.0 to v2.2.0

### Removed

- Stale `.agents/skills/commit-work/` fork (canonical version lives in `skills/commit-work/`)

### Fixed

- ASQM audit coverage gap (7 unscored skills)
- Roadmap acceptance criteria checkboxes now reflect actual completion status
- 7 markdownlint issues in `skills/analyze-requirements/SKILL.md` (MD032, MD040)

### Changed
